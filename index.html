  My children and what they love and interested in. I am glad to find out how to make my own website, because I have told my children that before they graduate they need to come up with a business. So this seems pretty easy to teach myself and my kids. LOL- they think I am crazy for making them come up with logos and what they want to have a business in. I am trying to have them be aware of being independent and working with what you love to do. This photo is when we went to Noah's Ark in Kentucky - a very long drive!!!
